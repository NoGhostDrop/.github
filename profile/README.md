# NoGhostDrop

## AI-Powered Sybil-Resistant Airdrop Platform

NoGhostDrop is an intelligent airdrop solution that uses on-chain behavior analysis powered by AI agent to distinguish between legitimate users and sybil wallets, ensuring tokens reach real, engaged community members.

## üåü The Problem

Airdrops have become a standard method for user acquisition, especially in new chain launches and protocol marketing campaigns. However, they are increasingly being exploited by:

- Bots and automated farming
- Sybil wallets (multiple wallets controlled by single entities)
- Token farmers with no genuine engagement

This exploitation:

- Dilutes token value
- Reduces marketing effectiveness
- Defeats the original purpose of airdrops:¬†**onboarding real users**

## üí° Our Solution

NoGhostDrop leverages AI agent to analyze on-chain behavior patterns and identify legitimate users. Our platform enables:

- **Smart Airdrops**: Create airdrops with custom eligibility conditions
- **AI Verification**: AI Agent-powered analysis of wallet behavior and transaction history
- **Secure Distribution**: Automated token distribution to verified wallets

## üîë Key Benefits

### For Foundations

- Increase ROI on marketing campaigns
- Target genuine community members
- Reduce waste from bot/sybil claims

### For Projects

- Ensure tokens reach real, engaged users
- Build authentic communities
- Protect token value

### For Developers

- Scale trustless airdrops across chains
- Minimize integration friction
- Leverage ready-made sybil resistance
- 

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Challenges & Solutions

### LLM Integration with ElizaOS

- Dedicated significant resources to learning the ElizaOS structure
- Iterated on prompt engineering to accurately classify wallets
- Developed sophisticated prompts to evaluate on-chain activity against airdrop conditions

### Performance Optimization

- Implemented parallel RPC requests for faster data processing
- Optimized data filtering to reduce unnecessary calls
- Significantly improved wallet evaluation speed

### Smart Contract Security

- Designed relayer-based execution model
- Implemented token locking mechanisms
- Created restricted transfer logic
- Built creator-only withdrawal functionality
- Coordinated backend logic with Solidity development

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Project Setup**: Create an airdrop and define eligibility conditions
2. **User Connection**: Users connect their wallet to the platform
3. **AI Analysis**: Our system analyzes wallet behavior and transaction history
4. **Verification**: Legitimate wallets are verified against project criteria
5. **Distribution**: Tokens are automatically distributed to eligible wallets
